      li Please take all your rubbish with you when you leave the site.
      li Nudism yeah, nationalism nay

      li Lost and found. If you lose or find anything, please contact the infopunkt.
      li The congress offers an open space for creative expression. In order to maintain this vision, we request you not to take any photos or videos.
    h3 Catering at the congress
    p From Thursday midday until Monday lunchtime, there will be three meals a day available. This year again we have a kitchen where you can help out. We welcome anyone who cares to come by and chop, stir and wash-up. The kitchen and all the food provided will be paid for by your contributions. For the meals the catering crew needs a contribution of about 5-10 Euros per person per day. If there is kitchen money left after the Congress, it will be donated to political projects.
