    h3 Catering at the congress
    p For the first time this year, there will be various, self-organised
    | groups providing catering at the congress. Everyone is welcome to help
    | chopping, cutting, cooking and stirring because it can be a really
    | stirring experience to join the fun of the participatory principle at
    | the Hedonist World Congress. A monetary contribution for these
    | delicacies is naturally expected. Should the contributions be more than
    | enough to cover the costs, they will be passed on to worthy social and
    | political projects.
